### Introduction 
Habitat adaptation is one of the key factors in evolutionary success and species radiation. Voles inhabit different biotopes worldwide. Close relatives with a little differences in genome live in forests and in rocky mountains. Moreover cryptic species live in the same Ðµcological niches, but differ genetically. Vole adaptation to different habitats occurs due to changes in gene expression. However, the differentially expressed genes were still not fully understood for voles from different habitats and cryptic species from the same habitat. 
We performed differential expression analysis for close relative species, inhabiting forests (*C. glareolus*), forest mountains (*C. nivalis*), rocky mountains (*A. lemminus*) and two cryptic species *L. raddei* & *L. gregalis* from steppe.
